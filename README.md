## Lindblad-simulation-for-Hubbard-Model

##### We employ the Hamiltonian simulation method to study open quantum systems within the Hubbard model. Following the approach outlined in https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.020332, we construct the Hamiltonian that governs these physical systems.

##### Then, using the method described in https://doi.org/10.1088/1402-4896/ad6499, we obtain the Pauli decomposition of the corresponding Hamiltonian. The exponential form of these Pauli strings is then leveraged to design quantum circuits for simulation.
